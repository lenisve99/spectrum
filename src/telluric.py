"""Telluric radial-velocity lookup and rest-frame shift.

The wavelength scale ``lambda_cal`` produced by ``pipeline.calibrate_night``
is in the frame of the upstream UVES data reduction, which is *not*
topocentric: telluric O2 lines in this dataset appear at velocities
ranging from −15 km/s (Feb) to −25 km/s (Apr), a clean seasonal pattern
that matches Earth's barycentric motion toward HD 49331. So the upstream
data already lives in a barycentric-like frame and the telluric
velocity in ``manifest.TELLURIC_KMS`` is, in practice, the apparent
shift of topocentric O2 lines in that frame (≈ -v_bary).

To put the stellar absorption lines at their laboratory rest wavelengths
we have to **undo** that upstream correction, i.e. shift back toward
topocentric. The empirical signature is unmistakable: the previous
implementation (which applied the correction in the opposite direction)
left ``v_rad + 2·v_tel`` constant to 0.7 km/s across 11 nights spanning
a 22 km/s swing in v_rad, indicating the correction was being applied
twice in the same direction. ``to_rest_frame`` now applies it once in
the correct direction.
